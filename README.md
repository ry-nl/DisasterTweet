## **NLP PROJECT**

### **Overview**
______________________________

Building a machine learning model to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are false alarms.

Perform data analysis on 'train.csv' dataset then apply to 'test.csv' dataset

### **datavisual.py**
______________________________

Use this file for exploratory data analysis
ie. making charts and shit to get insights

Objective: to figure out a way to process Tweets without the bullshit

### **model.py**
______________________________

The actual tensorflow learning model

### **tools.py**
______________________________

Any kind of modular function to be imported

Might split this up later into model tools and EDA tools
ie. data cleaning functions

SIDE NOTE: contains dictionary of acronyms/shortened words to be replaced, if you can come up with any acronym or shortened word that isn't in the list you can add it to the dictionary directly
